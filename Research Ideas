objectives
  research sensors 
    LDRs - have mjultiple LDRs or move an LDR - position of LDRs- higher=further but less accurate- have LDR on arm? - put LDR at the front 

    Infrared
    Ultrasonic 
    
  how to move 
    tank tread research / pros cons of other options 
      Pros tank: simple (Less likely to break), easy to program 
      Cons: slow, expensive, loud
    how wide apart would tracks be 
  motor power 
      how to configure motors
      where to put components - space to put 100g of weight 
      1 motors, 1 gearbox or just 2 motors - gearbox- more torque less speed, gearbox unnecessary? - something to distribute power from motor - adjust speed by adjusting power
      does speed need to change- try to move at speed of shade - 
      probably use 2 motors - one per wheel or tread - 
  Power off process
    Battery and Arduino 
      Transistor 
    How to bring it back 
      Standby? (secondary supply in smaller battery and small circuit board)

  How to hold weight 

Make it conscious
